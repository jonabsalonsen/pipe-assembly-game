# Pipe Assembly Game
**Pipe Assembly** is a puzzle game in which pipe pieces are combined and rotated in order to create a larger pipe. Still a work in progress.

The game is written in C++ using SDL2 and OpenGL and has been compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten on Ubuntu. All graphics are generated using GLSL shaders without the use of textures.
